# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews 🎭🔍

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on IMDB movie reviews using **Machine Learning models** like SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and MLP. It predicts whether a review is **positive** or **negative** based on text classification.

## 📂 Dataset
- Uses **IMDB Dataset** (sample of 3000 reviews)  
- Labels:  
  - **Positive** → 1  
  - **Negative** → 0  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** (Text Preprocessing)
- **Scikit-Learn** (ML Models)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)

## 🚀 Model Training & Evaluation
- Trained models: **SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, MLP**
- Evaluated using:
  - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve**

## 📊 Results
- Performance comparison of classifiers based on accuracy & loss.  
- Graphs for training loss & accuracy before/after full training.  

## 📜 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
